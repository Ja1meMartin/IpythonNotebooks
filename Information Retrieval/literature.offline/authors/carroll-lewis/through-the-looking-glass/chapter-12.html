<h1><a href="index-2.html">Through the Looking Glass</a></h1><h2><a href="../index.html">Lewis Carroll</a></h2><h3>Chapter 12 - Which Dreamed it?</h3>
<p />
<hr/>
<p>

  `Your majesty shouldn't purr so loud,' Alice said, rubbing her
eyes, and addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some
severity.  `You woke me out of oh! such a nice dream!  And you've
been along with me, Kitty -- all through the Looking-Glass world.
Did you know it, dear?'
<P>
  It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made
the remark) that, whatever you say to them, they Always purr.
`If them would only purr for "yes" and mew for "no," or any rule
of that sort,' she had said, `so that one could keep up a
conversation!  But how <I>can</I> you talk with a person if they always
say the same thing?'
<P>
  On this occasion the kitten only purred:  and it was impossible
to guess whether it meant `yes' or `no.'
<P>
  So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had
found the Red Queen:  then she went down on her knees on the
hearth-rug, and put the kitten and the Queen to look at each
other.  "Now, Kitty!' she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly.
`Confess that was what you turned into!'
<P>
  (`But it wouldn't look at it,' she said, when she was
explaining the thing afterwards to her sister: `it turned away
its head, and pretended not to see it:  but it looked a <I>little</I>
ashamed of itself, so I think it <I>must</I> have been the Red Queen.')
<P>
  `Sit up a little more stiffly, dear!' Alice cried with a merry
laugh.  `And curtsey while you're thinking what to -- what to
purr.  It saves time, remember!'  And she caught it up and gave
it one little kiss, `just in honour of having been a Red Queen.'
<P>
  `Snowdrop, my pet!' she went on, looking over her shoulder at
the White Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its
toilet, `when <I>will</I> Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I
wonder?  That must be the reason you were so untidy in my dream -
- Dinah!  do you know that you're scrubbing a White Queen?
Really, it's most disrespectful of you!
<P>
  `And what did <I>dinah</I> turn to, I wonder?' she prattled on, as she
settled comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin
in her hand, to watch the kittens.  `Tell me, Dinah, did you turn
to Humpty Dumpty?  I <I>think</I> you did -- however, you'd better not
mention it to your friends just yet, for I'm not sure.
<P>
  `By the way, Kitty, of only you'd been really with me in my
dream, there was one thing you <I>would</I> have enjoyed -- I had such a
quantity of poetry said to me, all about fishes!  To-morrow
morning you shall have a real treat.  All the time you're eating
your breakfast, I'll repeat "The Walrus and the Carpenter" to
you; and then you can make believe it's oysters, dear!
<P>
  `Now, Kitty, let's consider who it was that dreamed it all.
This is a serious question, my dear, and you should <I>not</I> go on
licking your paw like that -- as if Dinah hadn't washed you this
morning!  You see, Kitty, it <I>must</I> have been either me or the Red
King.  He was part of my dream, of course -- but then I was part
of his dream, too!  <I>was</I> it the Red King, Kitty.  You were his
wife, my dear, so you ought to know -- Oh, Kitty, <I>do</I> help to
settle it!  I'm sure your paw can wait!'  But the provoking
kitten only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn't heard
the question.
<P>
  Which do <I>you</I> think it was?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
            A boat beneath a sunny sky,<BR>
            Lingering onward dreamily<BR>
            In an evening of July --
<P>
            Children three that nestle near,<BR>
            Eager eye and willing ear,<BR>
            Pleased a simple tale to hear --
<P>
            Long had paled that sunny sky:<BR>
            Echoes fade and memories die.<BR>
            Autumn frosts have slain July.
<P>
            Still she haunts me, phantomwise,<BR>
            Alice moving under skies<BR>
            Never seen by waking eyes.
<P>
            Children yet, the tale to hear,<BR>
            Eager eye and willing ear,<BR>
            Lovingly shall nestle near.
<P>
            In a Wonderland they lie,<BR>
            Dreaming as the days go by,<BR>
            Dreaming as the summers die:
<P>
            Ever drifting down the stream --<BR>
            Lingering in the golden gleam --<BR>
            Life, what is it but a dream?
<P>
