<h1><a href="index-2.html">The Hunting of the Snark</a></h1><h2><a href="../index.html">Lewis Carroll</a></h2><h3>Preface</h3>
<p />
<hr/>
<p>

<H3>Preface</H3> 
<P>
If-and the thing is wildly possible-the charge of writing nonsense were ever 
brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem, it would be based
, I feel convinced, on the line (in Fit the Second) 
<P>
"<A NAME=BowSprit HREF="chapter-02.html#BowSprit">Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes</A>." 
<P>
In view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal 
indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of such a deed: 
I will not (as I might) point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself, 
to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it, or to its noble 
teachings in Natural History--I will take the more prosaic course of simply 
explaining how it happened. 
<P>
The Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used to 
have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished, and it more 
than once happened, when the time came for replacing it, that no one on board 
could remember which end of the ship it belonged to. They knew it was not of the
slightest use to appeal to the Bellman about it-- he would only refer to his 
Naval Code, and read out in pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which none of 
them had ever been able to understand-- so it generally ended in its being 
fastened on, anyhow, across the rudder. The helmsman used to stand by with tears
in his eyes; he knew it was all wrong, but alas! Rule 42 of the Code, "No one 
shall speak to the Man at the Helm," had been completed by the Bellman himself 
with the words "and the Man at the Helm shall speak to no one." So remonstrance 
was impossible, and no steering could be done till the next varnishing day. 
During these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards. 
<P>
As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock, let 
me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me, 
how to pronounce "slithy toves." The "i" in "slithy" is long, as in "writhe"; 
and "toves" is pronounced so as to rhyme with "groves." Again, the first "o" in 
"borogoves" is pronounced like the "o" in "borrow." I have heard people try to 
give it the sound of the "o" in "worry. Such is Human Perversity. 
<P>
This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard works in that 
poem. Humpty-Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word like a 
portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all. 
<P>
For instance, take the two words "fuming" and "furious." Make up your mind 
that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will say first. 
Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so little towards "
fuming," you will say "fuming-furious;" if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, 
towards "furious," you will say "furious-fuming;" but if you have the rarest of 
gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say "frumious." 
<P>
Supposing that, when Pistol uttered the well-known words-- 
<P>
Under which king, Bezonian? Speak or die!" 
<P>
Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or Richard, but 
had not been able to settle which, so that he could not possibly say either name
before the other, can it be doubted that, rather than die, he would have gasped 
out "Rilchiam!" 
<P>
