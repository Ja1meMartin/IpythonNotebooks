<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.<BR>
     "If only you'd spoken before!<BR>
It's excessively awkward to mention it now,<BR>
     With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!
<P>
"We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,<BR>
     If you never were met with again--<BR>
But surely, my man, when the voyage began,<BR>
     You might have suggested it then?
<P>
"It's excessively awkward to mention it now--<BR>
     As I think I've already remarked."<BR>
And the man they called "Hi!" replied, with a sigh,<BR>
     "I informed you the day we embarked.
<P>
"You may charge me with murder--or want of sense--<BR>
     (We are all of us weak at times):<BR>
But the slightest approach to a false pretense<BR>
     Was never among my crimes!
<P>
"I said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch--<BR>
     I said it in German and Greek:<BR>
But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)<BR>
     That English is what you speak!"
<P>
"'Tis a pitiful tale," said the Bellman, whose face<BR>
     Had grown longer at every word:<BR>
"But, now that you've stated the whole of your case,<BR>
     More debate would be simply absurd.
<P>
"The rest of my speech" (he explained to his men)<BR>
     "You shall hear when I've leisure to speak it.<BR>
But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!<BR>
     'Tis your glorious duty to seek it!
<P>
"To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;<BR>
     To pursue it with forks and hope;<BR>
To threaten its life with a railway-share;<BR>
     To charm it with smiles and soap!
<P>
"For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that won't<BR>
     Be caught in a commonplace way.<BR>
Do all that you know, and try all that you don't:<BR>
     Not a chance must be wasted to-day!
<P>
"For England expects--I forbear to proceed:<BR>
     'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:<BR>
And you'd best be unpacking the things that you need<BR>
     To rig yourselves out for the fight."
<P>
Then the Banker endorsed a blank check (which he crossed),<BR>
     And changed his loose silver for notes.<BR>
The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,<BR>
     And shook the dust out of his coats.
<P>
The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade--<BR>
     Each working the grindstone in turn:<BR>
But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed<BR>
     No interest in the concern:
<P>
Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,<BR>
     And vainly proceeded to cite<BR>
A number of cases, in which making laces<BR>
     Had been proved an infringement of right.
<P>
The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned<BR>
     A novel arrangement of bows:<BR>
While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand<BR>
     Was chalking the tip of his nose.
<P>
But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,<BR>
     With yellow kid gloves and a ruff--<BR>
Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,<BR>
     Which the Bellman declared was all "stuff."
<P>
"Introduce me, now there's a good fellow," he said,<BR>
     "If we happen to meet it together!"<BR>
And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,<BR>
     Said "That must depend on the weather."
<P>
The Beaver went simply galumphing about,<BR>
     At seeing the Butcher so shy:<BR>
And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,<BR>
     Made an effort to wink with one eye.
<P>
"Be a man!" said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard<BR>
     The Butcher beginning to sob.<BR>
"Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,<BR>
     We shall need all our strength for the job!"
