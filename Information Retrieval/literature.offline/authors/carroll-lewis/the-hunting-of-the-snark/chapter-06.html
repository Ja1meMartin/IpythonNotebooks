<h1><a href="index-2.html">The Hunting of the Snark</a></h1><h2><a href="../index.html">Lewis Carroll</a></h2><h3>Fit the Sixth - The Barrister's Dream</h3>
<p />
<hr/>
<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<BR>
     They pursued it with forks and hope;<BR>
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<BR>
     They charmed it with smiles and soap.
<P>
But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain<BR>
     That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,<BR>
Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain<BR>
     That his fancy had dwelt on so long.
<P>
He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,<BR>
     Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,<BR>
Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig<BR>
     On the charge of deserting its sty.
<P>
The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,<BR>
     That the sty was deserted when found:<BR>
And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law<BR>
     In a soft under-current of sound.
<P>
The indictment had never been clearly expressed,<BR>
     And it seemed that the Snark had begun,<BR>
And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed<BR>
     What the pig was supposed to have done.
<P>
The Jury had each formed a different view<BR>
     (Long before the indictment was read),<BR>
And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew<BR>
     One word that the others had said.
<P>
"You must know ---" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed "Fudge!"<BR>
     That statute is obsolete quite!<BR>
Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends<BR>
     On an ancient manorial right.
<P>
"In the matter of Treason the pig would appear<BR>
     To have aided, but scarcely abetted:<BR>
While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,<BR>
     If you grant the plea 'never indebted.'
<P>
"The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;<BR>
     But its guilt, as I trust, is removed<BR>
(So far as related to the costs of this suit)<BR>
     By the Alibi which has been proved.
<P>
"My poor client's fate now depends on you votes."<BR>
     Here the speaker sat down in his place,<BR>
And directed the Judge to refer to his notes<BR>
     And briefly to sum up the case.
<P>
But the Judge said he never had summed up before;<BR>
     So the Snark undertook it instead,<BR>
And summed it so well that it came to far more<BR>
     Than the Witnesses ever had said!
<P>
When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,<BR>
     As the word was so puzzling to spell;<BR>
But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind<BR>
     Undertaking that duty as well.
<P>
So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,<BR>
     It was spent with the toils of the day:<BR>
When it said the word "GUILTY!" the Jury all groaned,<BR>
     And some of them fainted away.
<P>
Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite<BR>
     Too nervous to utter a word:<BR>
When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,<BR>
     And the fall of a pin might be heard.
<P>
"Transportation for life" was the sentence it gave,<BR>
     "And *then* to be fined forty pound."<BR>
The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared<BR>
     That the phrase was not legally sound.
<P>
But their wild exultation was suddenly checked<BR>
     When the jailer informed them, with tears,<BR>
Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,<BR>
     As the pig had been dead for some years.
<P>
The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:<BR>
     But the Snark, though a little aghast,<BR>
As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted,<BR>
     Went bellowing on to the last.
<P>
Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed<BR>
     To grow every moment more clear:<BR>
Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,<BR>
     Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.
