<h1><a href="index-2.html">The Hunting of the Snark</a></h1><h2><a href="../index.html">Lewis Carroll</a></h2><h3>Fit the First - The Landing</h3>
<p />
<hr/>
<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,<BR>
     As he landed his crew with care;<BR>
Supporting each man on the top of the tide<BR>
     By a finger entwined in his hair.
<P>
"Just the place for a Snark!  I have said it twice:<BR>
     That alone should encourage the crew.<BR>
Just the place for a Snark!  I have said it thrice:<BR>
     What i tell you three times is true."
<P>
The crew was complete: it included a Boots--<BR>
     A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--<BR>
A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes--<BR>
     And a Broker, to value their goods.
<P>
A Billiard-maker, whose skill was immense,<BR>
     Might perhaps have won more than his share--<BR>
But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,<BR>
     Had the whole of their cash in his care.
<P>
There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,<BR>
     Or would sit making lace in the bow:<BR>
And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,<BR>
     Though none of the sailors knew how.
<P>
There was one who was famed for the number of things<BR>
     He forgot when he entered the ship:<BR>
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,<BR>
     And the clothes he had bought for the trip.
<P>
He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,<BR>
     With his name painted clearly on each:<BR>
But, since he omitted to mention the fact,<BR>
     They were all left behind on the beach.
<P>
The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because<BR>
     He had seven coats on when he came,<BR>
With three pairs of boots--but the worst of it was,<BR>
     He had wholly forgotten his name.
<P>
He would answer to "Hi!" or to any loud cry,<BR>
     Such as "Fry me!" or "Fritter my wig!"<BR>
To "What-you-may-call-um!" or "What-was-his-name!"<BR>
     But especially "Thing-um-a-jig!"
<P>
While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,<BR>
     He had different names from these:<BR>
His intimate friends called him "Candle-ends,"<BR>
     And his enemies "Toasted-cheese."
<P>
"His form in ungainly--his intellect small--"<BR>
     (So the Bellman would often remark)<BR>
"But his courage is perfect!  And that, after all,<BR>
     Is the thing that one needs with a Snark."
<P>
He would joke with hyenas, returning their stare<BR>
     With an impudent wag of the head:<BR>
And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,<BR>
     "Just to keep up its spirits," he said.
<P>
He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late--<BR>
     And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--<BR>
He could only bake Bridecake--for which, I may state,<BR>
     No materials were to be had.
<P>
The last of the crew needs especial remark,<BR>
     Though he looked an incredible dunce:<BR>
He had just one idea--but, that one being "Snark,"<BR>
     The good Bellman engaged him at once.
<P>
He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,<BR>
     When the ship had been sailing a week,<BR>
He could only kill Beavers.  The Bellman looked scared,<BR>
     And was almost too frightened to speak:
<P>
But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,<BR>
     There was only one Beaver on board;<BR>
And that was a tame one he had of his own,<BR>
     Whose death would be deeply deplored.
<P>
The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,<BR>
     Protested, with tears in its eyes,<BR>
That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark<BR>
     Could atone for that dismal surprise!
<P>
It strongly advised that the Butcher should be<BR>
     Conveyed in a separate ship:<BR>
But the Bellman declared that would never agree<BR>
     With the plans he had made for the trip:
<P>
Navigation was always a difficult art,<BR>
     Though with only one ship and one bell:<BR>
And he feared he must really decline, for his part,<BR>
     Undertaking another as well.
<P>
The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure<BR>
     A second-hand dagger-proof coat--<BR>
So the Baker advised it-- and next, to insure<BR>
     Its life in some Office of note:
<P>
This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire<BR>
     (On moderate terms), or for sale,<BR>
Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,<BR>
     And one Against Damage From Hail.
<P>
Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,<BR>
     Whenever the Butcher was by,<BR>
The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,<BR>
     And appeared unaccountably shy.
