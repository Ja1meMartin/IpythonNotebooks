<h1><a href="index-2.html">The Hunting of the Snark</a></h1><h2><a href="../index.html">Lewis Carroll</a></h2><h3>Fit the Third - The Baker's Tale</h3>
<p />
<hr/>
<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--<BR>
     They roused him with mustard and cress--<BR>
They roused him with jam and judicious advice--<BR>
     They set him conundrums to guess.
<P>
When at length he sat up and was able to speak,<BR>
     His sad story he offered to tell;<BR>
And the Bellman cried "Silence!  Not even a shriek!"<BR>
     And excitedly tingled his bell.
<P>
There was silence supreme!  Not a shriek, not a scream,<BR>
     Scarcely even a howl or a groan,<BR>
As the man they called "Ho!" told his story of woe<BR>
     In an antediluvian tone.
<P>
"My father and mother were honest, though poor--"<BR>
     "Skip all that!" cried the Bellman in haste.<BR>
"If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark--<BR>
     We have hardly a minute to waste!"
<P>
"I skip forty years," said the Baker, in tears,<BR>
     "And proceed without further remark<BR>
To the day when you took me aboard of your ship<BR>
     To help you in hunting the Snark.
<P>
"A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)<BR>
     Remarked, when I bade him farewell--"<BR>
"Oh, skip your dear uncle!" the Bellman exclaimed,<BR>
     As he angrily tingled his bell.
<P>
"He remarked to me then," said that mildest of men,<BR>
     " 'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:<BR>
Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens,<BR>
     And it's handy for striking a light.
<P>
" 'You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care;<BR>
     You may hunt it with forks and hope;<BR>
You may threaten its life with a railway-share;<BR>
     You may charm it with smiles and soap--' "
<P>
("That's exactly the method," the Bellman bold<BR>
     In a hasty parenthesis cried,<BR>
"That's exactly the way I have always been told<BR>
     That the capture of Snarks should be tried!")
<P>
" 'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,<BR>
     If your Snark be a Boojum!  For then<BR>
You will softly and suddenly vanish away,<BR>
     And never be met with again!'
<P>
"It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,<BR>
     When I think of my uncle's last words:<BR>
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl<BR>
     Brimming over with quivering curds!
<P>
"It is this, it is this--" "We have had that before!"<BR>
     The Bellman indignantly said.<BR>
And the Baker replied "Let me say it once more.<BR>
     It is this, it is this that I dread!
<P>
"I engage with the Snark--every night after dark--<BR>
     In a dreamy delirious fight:<BR>
I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,<BR>
     And I use it for striking a light:
<P>
"But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,<BR>
     In a moment (of this I am sure),<BR>
I shall softly and suddenly vanish away--<BR>
     And the notion I cannot endure!"
