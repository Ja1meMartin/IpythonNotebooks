<h1><a href="index-2.html">The Hunting of the Snark</a></h1><h2><a href="../index.html">Lewis Carroll</a></h2><h3>Fit the Second - The Bellman's Speech</h3>
<p />
<hr/>
<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--<BR>
     Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!<BR>
Such solemnity, too!  One could see he was wise,<BR>
     The moment one looked in his face!
<P>
He had bought a large map representing the sea,<BR>
     Without the least vestige of land:<BR>
And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be<BR>
     A map they could all understand.
<P>
"What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,<BR>
     Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?"<BR>
So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply<BR>
     "They are merely conventional signs!
<P>
"Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!<BR>
     But we've got our brave Captain to thank:<BR>
(So the crew would protest) "that he's bought us the best--<BR>
     A perfect and absolute blank!"
<P>
This was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out<BR>
     That the Captain they trusted so well<BR>
Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,<BR>
     And that was to tingle his bell.
<P>
He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave<BR>
     Were enough to bewilder a crew.<BR>
When he cried "Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!"<BR>
     What on earth was the helmsman to do?
<P>
<A NAME=BowSprit HREF="preface.html#BowSprit">
Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:</A><BR>
     A thing, as the Bellman remarked,<BR>
That frequently happens in tropical climes,<BR>
     When a vessel is, so to speak, "snarked."
<P>
But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,<BR>
     And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,<BR>
Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,<BR>
     That the ship would not travel due West!
<P>
But the danger was past--they had landed at last,<BR>
     With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:<BR>
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,<BR>
     Which consisted to chasms and crags.
<P>
The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,<BR>
     And repeated in musical tone<BR>
Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--<BR>
     But the crew would do nothing but groan.
<P>
He served out some grog with a liberal hand,<BR>
     And bade them sit down on the beach:<BR>
And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,<BR>
     As he stood and delivered his speech.
<P>
"Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!"<BR>
     (They were all of them fond of quotations:<BR>
So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,<BR>
     While he served out additional rations).
<P>
"We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,<BR>
     (Four weeks to the month you may mark),<BR>
But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)<BR>
     Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!
<P>
"We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,<BR>
     (Seven days to the week I allow),<BR>
But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,<BR>
     We have never beheld till now!
<P>
"Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again<BR>
     The five unmistakable marks<BR>
By which you may know, wheresoever you go,<BR>
     The warranted genuine Snarks.
<P>
"Let us take them in order.  The first is the taste,<BR>
     Which is meager and hollow, but crisp:<BR>
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,<BR>
     With a flavor of Will-o-the-wisp.
<P>
"Its habit of getting up late you'll agree<BR>
     That it carries too far, when I say<BR>
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,<BR>
     And dines on the following day.
<P>
"The third is its slowness in taking a jest.<BR>
     Should you happen to venture on one,<BR>
It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:<BR>
     And it always looks grave at a pun.
<P>
"The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,<BR>
     Which is constantly carries about,<BR>
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--<BR>
     A sentiment open to doubt.
<P>
"The fifth is ambition.  It next will be right<BR>
     To describe each particular batch:<BR>
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,<BR>
     And those that have whiskers, and scratch.
<P>
"For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,<BR>
     Yet, I feel it my duty to say,<BR>
Some are Boojums--" The Bellman broke off in alarm,<BR>
     For the Baker had fainted away.
